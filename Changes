Revision history for Perl extension ToolHelp.

0.31    Sat Mar  28 22:30:30 2009
	No changes; just trying to get a tarball that is acceptable to the CPAN
	indexer...
	
0.3	    Sat Mar  28 21:35:06 2009
	This version uploaded by knth@cpan.org. Steffen Mueller has graciously
	made me co-maintainer for the moment as the real maintainer is currently
	unavailable.

	Added the possibility to build with the gcc toolchain (MinGW).
	Specifically, detecting use of gcc and making sure lib creation
	options are correct when 'ar' is used instead of 'lib.

	  hadn't found quickly the reason)
