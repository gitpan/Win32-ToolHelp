Revision history for Perl extension ToolHelp.

0.32    Thu Oct 29 12:35:00 2009
	Failed to get this to work with ActivePerl 5.10.1 1006 and 'nmake'.
	For mysterious reasons my nmake says it does the compile for Impl.c
	but no .o file is produced. My nmake is 6.00.9782.0, will investigate
	to see if other versions work. Adapt to use dmake as an alternative.
	
	* Changed the command for creating the archive to use a tab instead of
	spaces since dmake won't recognize it otherwise.
	* Also adapted to the fact that Config{ar} no longer contained just 'ar',
	but a full path.
	* Added specific tarflags for the dist target since (at least my) tar puts
	some very stupid modes on the files (specifically, no x for directories)
	which creates problems when uploading to PAUSE.

	No changes; just trying to get a tarball that is acceptable to the CPAN
	indexer...
	
0.3	    Sat Mar  28 21:35:06 2009
	This version uploaded by knth@cpan.org. Steffen Mueller has graciously
	made me co-maintainer for the moment as the real maintainer is currently
	unavailable.

	Added the possibility to build with the gcc toolchain (MinGW).
	Specifically, detecting use of gcc and making sure lib creation
	options are correct when 'ar' is used instead of 'lib.

	! quotation marks were cut from the XS_VERSION passed to the compiler
	  via -DXS_VERSION=\"0.1\" (XS_VERSION redefined in ToolHelp.xs as I
	  hadn't found quickly the reason)
